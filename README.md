# CMPM121SampleScene
My scene is the view of the world from a tiny person's point of view, and also a fun little scene with some animals and such. I included all sorts of animals like
crows, spiders, butterflies, turtles, etc. Beyond that I also made a pretty typhical forest, but I upscale the detailed meshes like detailed grass and mushrooms so
they would be more detailed when upscaled. I was actually inspired by a manga named "Hakumei and Mikochi", which features a beautifully crafted world of little people
and all sorts of animals and the unique culture they've developed. If I have the time I'd like to reworkd my scene to fit my vision of that inspiration more, but that
will have to wait for the future. The main character for now is a simple red square; I plan on replacing it with a 3d model of a character I'd prefer to make myself.
